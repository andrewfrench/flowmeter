# flowmeter
Flowmeter TI board/MQTT demo

This demo requires a TI CC3200 and Energia, and was designed to accept 
input from Swissflow 800 flowmeters.  Interrupts are bound to the two 
pushbuttons and their respective header pins, allowing the demo to be 
run without flowmeters available if necessary.
